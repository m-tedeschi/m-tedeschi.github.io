      <h1>Welcome to Mike Tedeschi's CSC106 Portfolio!</h1>
      <p>On this web site, you'll find some of my works produced during my<br> time at the University of Rhode Island for the course <b>CSC106: The Joy of Programming</b>.<br> In this course, we'll be exploring some more introductory programming with the language JavaScript. We will also be considering applications of programming that can be used to solve problems. <br>Presently the site is still in its early stages, but please take a look around and check back soon to see what I've cooked up!</p>
