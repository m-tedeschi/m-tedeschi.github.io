      <h1>Welcome to Mike's Portfolio!</h1>
      <p>On this web site, you'll find some of my works produced during my<br> time at the University of Rhode Island for the course <b>CSC106: The Joy of Programming</b>.<br> In this course, we'll be exploring some more introductory programming with the language JavaScript. We will also be considering applications of programming that can be used to solve problems. Presently the site is still in its early stages, but please take a look around and check back soon to see what I've cooked up!</p>
